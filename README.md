# VirtualMachine
A simple compiler and virtual machine developed for a fictitious, limited functionality variant of the programming language Go.  This project encompasses all the phases of compilation from lexical analysis, parsing, translation to virtual machine generation. The code however, currently works fully for Integer data type.
